Builds on the fundamentals of continuous feedback control to introduce the student to computer(digital) regulation of systems 
in closed-loop.  Discrete-time modeling of signals and systems is discussed.Analog and digital control schemes are compared using
s domain to z-domain conversion, and time-domainresponse characterization.  Closed-loop system design objective speci cation and 
evaluation is conductedthrough numerical simulation.  Various discrete-time controller designs are implemented.  Topics for this
include:  continuous to digital control conversion using  finite difference solutions; continuous to digital control conversion using
state equation approach; stability of discrete systems; PID control design for digital systems; frequency domain control system design 
methods for continuous systems (PID, lead, lag, lead-lagcompensation design); frequency domain control system design methods for digital 
systems (PID, lead, lag,lead-lag compensation design) using phase loss methods and bilinear transformation; z-transforms for discrete
systems; digital control system design using root locus ; and deadbeat control design. It will be required to do computer projects 
using National Instruments hardware,Labview, Arduinos, and Matlab/Simulink.
